\section{Materials and Methods}

This is how you add references \cite{Deen2019}, \cite{Doe2020}.

% example equation
And this is a dummy equation
\begin{equation}
I_\alpha = \int_0^\alpha f(x) dx
\end{equation}

% example two column figure (use figure instead of figure* for one column figure)
\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./fig1.pdf}
  \caption{This a dummy figure to be replaced.}
  \label{fig:dummyfigure}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:dummyfigure} shows how to include a figure.
Table \ref{tab:dummytable} shows how to include a table.
